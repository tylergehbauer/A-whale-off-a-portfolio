# A-whale-off-the-portfolio
Unit 4 Homework Assignment: Pandas

For this assignment I was asked to:

>1.Read in and Wrangle Returns Data

>2.Determine Success of Each Portfolio

>3.Choose and Evaluate a Custom Portfolio

Reading the data was simple enough, we've done it many times in class. 
However, to same time I indexed the 'date' column and made the dates in date_time_format in the same command. 

Concating data, performing risk analysis, rolling statisitcs, and calculating sharpe ratios were all very similar to what we did in class.

I would say the Student Activites for portfolio returns parts 1 & 2, caluclating Sharpe Ratios, and caluclating betas helped me with this homework assignment the most. 
Much of the concatting, calculating, and plotting was done in the portoflio returns exersice. 

I chose to use Disney, Neftlix, and AMC for my custom portfolio of stocks.
I used the GOOGLEFINANCE function on Google Seets to aquire my data. 
All analysis on my portfolio was similar to what I computed on the previous part of this assignment.

I would say that my portfolio performed decently based on the Sharpe Ratio's. My portfolio had a pretty high risk with decent returns according to the standard deviations and beta calcuulations. 
However, through out this whole analysis the best performing portfolio/algorithm was Harold's Algo 1.
